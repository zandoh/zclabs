As a passionate developer and music enthusiast, I aimed to create a personal portfolio that not only showcased my technical skills but also integrated seamlessly with platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Spotify](https://spotify.com/). Leveraging technologies like [Astro](https://astro.build/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), and [Redis](https://redis.io/), I embarked on a journey to develop a dynamic and engaging portfolio that not only reflects my professional capabilities but also reflects my personality and interests.

## Github

Utilizing the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest), I incorporated functionality to fetch and display my most recent GitHub activity directly on my portfolio. This included repositories I've contributed to, commits made, and issues opened or closed. This integration not only serves as a showcase of my coding activity but also adds a layer of interactivity to the portfolio.

## Spotify

For the Spotify integration, I utilized the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to fetch the current playing track, if available, and prominently display it on my portfolio. In addition, I developed a robust feature enabling users to search the Spotify API directly from my portfolio, facilitating the addition of selected songs or podcasts to a designated playlist within my library.

The implementation of GitHub and Spotify integrations resulted in a highly engaging and personalized portfolio. Visitors can now not only explore my projects and contributions but also get insights into my music preferences and suggest new content!
